@its5oclocksw twitter bot
==

Every timezone hour offset the bot tweets the name of a city in which it is currently 5 o clock, if one exists.

also tags the tweet as being in that city if that is possible

It is surprisingly difficult to get a mapping from timezone to cities in that timezone (even tz->country->city)

This is because it is a useless mapping. Nobody wants this information.
